Chromium Vendor Repo
========
[![Build Status](http://jenkins.carbonrom.org/job/Chromium/badge/icon)](http://jenkins.carbonrom.org/job/Chromium/)

This repository contains the pre-built binaries of Chromium for Android.

### Current Version
The current version is 2395.

### Is it signed?
As of 2395, Chromium is now signed with internal keys. If you want to resign the apks, feel free.

### But where is my awesomely hideous AOSP Browser?
AOSP Browser is in dire need of a UI refresh, and I'm not the guy to do that. So, enter here Chromium.

### How does Chromium differ from Chrome?
It barely has any noticable differences. 

### Can I use these pre-built binaries in my own ROM?
Feel free, Chromium is an open-source project by The Chromium Project, we haz no control over what you do with these apks. Just don't forget to thank the amazing Chromium devs for their hard-work and if you want to thank us for the regular Chromium builds, that'd be awesome too.

### Can I distribute in the Play Store as my own work?
Chromium for Android isn't even our own work, it's a FOSS project. That being said, no. You should feel bad for even asking this. But, if you're making major changes and want to contribute them back to the Chromium upstream code, contact the devs. :) 

### How do I submit new binaries to this repo?
We build our own Chromium binaries everyday that we have weekly releases. But, if you notice that our repo is behind, feel free to submit new binaries to the vendor project on our [Gerrit] instance. Be warned though, there's a really high chance we won't accept it.


### How to Build Chromium?
You can find instructions on the [Chromium Website]

### But I have more question?
If you have more questions, feel free to contact root on his [Google+]. Be considerate when it relates to time, he is on the East Coast so messaging him anytime during the day is okay. If you message him after midnight (EDT), there's a really high chance you will get ignored and/or blocked.
